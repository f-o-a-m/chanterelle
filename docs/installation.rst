=========
installing Chanterelle CLI
=========

you can install `master` of chanterelle CLI globally using npm:

.. code-block:: shell

    npm install -g f-o-a-m/chanterelle

Or if you would like to install specific version like `v9.9.9 for example do:

.. code-block:: shell

    npm install -g f-o-a-m/chanterelle#v9.9.9

you can also install it locally for particular project too:


.. code-block:: shell

    npm install f-o-a-m/chanterelle


NOTE: The projects where CLI is used, must also have chanterelle in it's purescript dependencies and whole purescript project should be compiled already.
